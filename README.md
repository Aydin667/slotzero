# SlotZero — launches born locked

**slotzero.lol** is a Pump.fun launchpad where the creator's allocation is
**provably locked before the token exists**.

A SlotZero launch is one atomic Jito bundle, landing in a single slot — the
token's *slot zero*:

1. **tx1** — Pump.fun `create_v2` + the creator's dev buy (one transaction:
   nothing can trade before the dev buy).
2. **tx2** — 100% of the bought tokens are deposited into a
   [Jupiter Lock](https://lock.jup.ag) vesting escrow (`cancel_mode = NONE`,
   `update_recipient_mode = NONE` — uncancellable), followed by a
   [Lighthouse](https://github.com/Jac0xb/lighthouse) assertion that the
   creator's wallet holds **exactly zero** unlocked tokens. Plus platform fee
   and Jito tip.
3. **tx3** — a launch certificate is written via the
   [Solana Attestation Service](https://solana.com/docs/tools/attestations),
   keyed by mint, readable by any bot or terminal.

Because the bundle is all-or-nothing, **the token cannot exist in a state
where the dev holds an unlocked bag**. This is enforcement at launch time, on
Pump.fun's own venue — not post-hoc scanning.

## What makes it unique

- Tokens are **real Pump.fun tokens** — same program
  (`6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P`), same bonding curve, same
  PumpSwap graduation.
- **No custom smart contract.** The launch composes four audited, live
  programs (Pump, Jupiter Lock, Lighthouse, SAS). Our code only builds
  transactions the creator signs in their own wallet.
- **No database.** Launches are enumerated from the on-chain attestations
  under our SAS credential; the verifier recomputes every check against live
  chain state. The public record *is* the record.
- **Public verifier API** for terminals and TG bots:
  `GET /api/verify/<mint>`, `GET /api/launches`.

Signing model: the creator signs tx1+tx2 via their wallet
(`signAllTransactions`); the server contributes the mint keypair (required
signer of `create_v2`), the ephemeral escrow base key, and the platform key
(tx3). The server **refuses to co-sign** any transaction whose message bytes
differ from what it issued.

The platform key custodies nothing: it issues attestations (paying ~0.003 SOL
rent per launch), receives the flat platform fee, and holds no user funds.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local        # fill in values (see below)
node scripts/gen-key.mjs          # → PLATFORM_KEYPAIR for .env.local
npm run dev
```

Set `DRY_RUN=1` to exercise the full pipeline against mainnet state without
spending SOL (transactions are simulated, never sent — no token is created).
With a Helius RPC the dry run uses `simulateBundle` to validate all three
transactions statefully; on RPCs without it, tx1 is simulated alone.

### Environment variables

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SOLANA_RPC_URL` | Server-side RPC (Helius recommended; needs `getProgramAccounts`) |
| `PLATFORM_KEYPAIR` | base58 secret key — attestation issuer + fee receiver. Fund with ~0.05 SOL |
| `PINATA_JWT`, `PINATA_GATEWAY` | IPFS pinning for token image + metadata |
| `JITO_BLOCK_ENGINE_URL` | default `https://mainnet.block-engine.jito.wtf` |
| `JITO_TIP_LAMPORTS` | default 1000000 (0.001 SOL) |
| `PLATFORM_FEE_LAMPORTS` | default 20000000 (0.02 SOL) |
| `DRY_RUN` | `1` = simulate only |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | canonical origin |

### One-time chain setup

After funding the platform key:

```bash
SOLANA_RPC_URL=... PLATFORM_KEYPAIR=... node scripts/setup-sas.mjs
```

creates the `SlotZero` SAS credential and `SealedLaunchV1` schema
(idempotent).

## Pump.fun integration

Direct on-chain integration via the official `@pump-fun/pump-sdk` v2
(`createV2AndBuyInstructions`) against the published IDLs in
[pump-fun/pump-public-docs](https://github.com/pump-fun/pump-public-docs). No
PumpPortal or reverse-engineered endpoints. New pump mints are Token-2022;
the escrow leg is built Token-2022-native. Metadata is a Metaplex-style JSON
pinned to IPFS (the old `pump.fun/api/ipfs` endpoint is defunct).

Dev-buy token amounts are deterministic because the bundle guarantees the
buy is the curve's first trade — computed with the SDK's own curve math from
the on-chain `Global` + fee config.

## Deployment (Render)

- Build: `npm ci && npm run build` — Start: `npm start`
- Health check: `/api/health`
- Set all env vars in the Render dashboard (never commit them).
- In-memory session/caches are per-instance: run a single instance (the
  free/starter tiers do). Sessions are 10-minute launch flows; loss on deploy
  is harmless (prepare again).

## Domain

`slotzero.lol` (Porkbun) → Render custom domain. Apex `slotzero.lol` is
canonical; `www` redirects. DNS: apex A/ALIAS per Render's instructions +
`www` CNAME to the service host.

## Troubleshooting

- **`SESSION_NOT_FOUND` on execute** — the 10-minute launch session expired
  or the instance restarted; rebuild the launch (nothing landed on-chain).
- **Bundle `expired`** — didn't land before blockhash expiry (congestion/low
  tip). Atomic: nothing happened; retry, optionally raise `JITO_TIP_LAMPORTS`.
- **`launches` empty** — RPC must support `getProgramAccounts` with memcmp
  filters (public RPC often rejects; use Helius).
- **Attestation tx fails** — platform key unfunded, or `setup-sas.mjs` not
  run yet.
- **Verify page shows WARN on atomicity** — RPC transaction history pruned;
  escrow/certificate checks still authoritative.

## Disclaimers

SlotZero is not affiliated with Pump.fun. A seal proves the creator's
declared allocation is locked; it does not prevent third-party snipers or
outside-funded wallets, and it is not investment advice. Memecoins are
extremely risky.
